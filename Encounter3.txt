-“rapidly prototyping speculative ideas”
-this is the first event — we have invited Professor Smith
	-we are calling these events encounters
	-we will meet, talk, and speculate as a group
	-these will then take physical shape in one way or another

Pamela Smith
The Making and Knowing Project 
-first i will contest dennis’s opposition between craft and scientific laboratory. 
-^ that’s only how scientists wish it happens
-“chemical heritage foundation”
-my work has focus on craft throughout my whole career
-Bernard Plissy — you can’t just do this in writing
	-“as a historian, this is a problem for me.”
	-“I don’t have access to that skill, and to those actual making abilities.” 
	-“that is my paradox”
-manuscripts and texts on making 
	-“a flood of how to literature”
	-the book of secrets — technical recipes
	-flood of technical literature that appears from 1400 on: WHY, why did it appear, why was there an audience for 	it? 
	-eventually incorporated into encyclopedia projects of 19th (?) century
-problem of reproducibility in science
-JoVE = attempt to respond to that problem of reproducibility: youtube videos that show the process of those experiments
	-rapidly growing
-how to get at practical knowledge as a historian — how do you actually GET it
-in order to get at this knowledge, i realized i needed to have an apprenticeship in medieval techniques
	-took a bunch of apprenticeships
		-oil painting, metalworking, bread making
	-Victoria & Albert museum: first founded as a place where artisans and  industrialists would get together and 	record and archive all kinds of processes that were valuable to the nation
		-porcelain, for example
	-the same strangeness that inhabits art history and history of science — almost nobody is trained in those 	materials today. (it’s changing…but, anyway.)
	-West Dean college of arts: making courses
-“the chemistry of isaac newton project”
	-what historians thought was metaphorical or something was actually just material” 
-example of life casting: “how to cast a lizard” 
	-found multiple life casting instructions — did experiments to try to reconstruct these instructions
	-“reverse engineering” from words to experience
-what kind of historical evidence is available to historians of material life? not just the materials in terms of their makeup but what did they mean to people
	-you are dealing with an emergent phenomenon, and yet you are going to say historical things about it
	-generally, you never get the same thing — and how do you get evidence of that? actually an archival 	document is an emergent phenomenon as well. 

(1) French Paleography Workshop 
	-collectively produced critical edition of this manuscript, annotated with tons of information 
	-worked in pairs on transcription and translation
	-collective workspace was google drive
	-within each folder is high definition scan, diplomatic transcription (lightly encoded), normal transcription, 	english translation. we decided to keep it very, very simple.
	-permissions access is a huge problem for us, and shock when you find something new in your google drive 	when
	-retroactive correction - but ad hoc is really the only way to move forward on such a big project 
(2) Laboratory Seminar
	-history course in which the research is done in a lab
	-had to show them youtube videos on sand casting
	-first we did skill building: historical culinary recipes 
	-the way we’re recording everything is by field notes (NOT blog)
	-person who came in to talk about lab notes said “maybe don’t include information about how you had to go get 	rose hips in queens”)
	-HOW do we organize all this information so that it will be available five years hence
		-we change this wiki almost every week
	-a lot of recipe genealogies as well — where did these recipes come from? 
(3) Oversight Component
	-bring all these people together, assign them different annotations, gives us an expert oversight over the 	annotations. 
	-the students are producing original research every day in class.
	-everyone is very excited these days
	-layers— manuscript, transcription, translation etc. 
	-we will be able to embed images in our reconstructions too 
	-how to catch a lizard tutorial — longterm continuity of these techniques
	-brood nest of snakes — intersection of engagement with real world with making. how do you catch a lizard and 	keep it so that it won’t die so you can kill it for your life cast? 

-coordinating access to 90+ collaborators on google drive (can only go to google or make own platform)
-organizing wikispace: tagging, the place where we store all our photos is in flickr photo stream b/c took way too long to upload anything to wikispace (and how do you organize that rationally)
-And how do you make all these speak to each other 
-embedding the frames of the google drive to the wiki — can link to google drive from wiki b/c at the moment we are cutting and pasting things from googledrive to wiki 
-we have to have a way to link, directly ^^.
-linking these three archives in whatever way possible so they speak to each other so we can at least search them for information 
-next semester, we are scaling up to collaborate in real time to with other courses at other institutions. 
	in the netherlands germany ireland other places in us 
-we want to have virtual conferencing 

Brainstorming (!!!!!!)
-obvious ideas: 
	-version control (github)(for text)
	-wikimedia
	-the internet archive: some big storage

critical edition: will simply be available, to anyone (after 5 years) 
what kind of uses to you envision? 
	-conservators? 


critical edition: will simply be available, to anyone (after 5 years) 
what kind of uses to you envision? 
	-conservators? 
	-there could be a cs class happening at the same time COMPUTING IN CONTEXT and nobody likes to solve 	problems retrospectively 
	-Camille (?) Brothers 
	-this isn’t a computer science problem, and this idea of collaboration isn’t isolated to cs 
	-we’re not looking for an algorithm. collaboration of design, humanities
	-art historians — trying to collaborate on images.
